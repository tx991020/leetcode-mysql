##184.分组取最大值
###解题思路###
第一种思路where要加上组别相等的条件，其余的一致where，1，count
第二种思路where...not exists(true才会被筛选出来)意思就是不存在才会被筛选出来
第三种思路笛卡尔积再根据指标相等条件来筛选
第四种是采用in的方法，而且可以两个指标一起查询
###代码###
####第一种####
    select b.name as department,a.name as employee,a.salary
    from
    employee a,department b
    where 
    a.departmentid=b.id
    and
    1>(select count(distinct salary) from employee where departmentid=a.departmentid and salary>a.salary)
####第二种####
    SELECT D.Name,A.Name,A.Salary 
    FROM 
    	Employee A,
    	Department D   
    WHERE A.DepartmentId = D.Id 
      AND NOT EXISTS 
      (SELECT 1 FROM Employee B WHERE B.Salary > A.Salary AND A.DepartmentId = B.DepartmentId)
####第三种####
    SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary 
    FROM
    	Employee E,
    	(SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId) T,
    	Department D
    WHERE E.DepartmentId = T.DepartmentId 
      AND E.Salary = T.max
      AND E.DepartmentId = D.id
####第四种####
    SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary 
    from 
    	Employee E,
    	Department D 
    WHERE E.DepartmentId = D.id 
      AND (DepartmentId,Salary) in
      (SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId)
