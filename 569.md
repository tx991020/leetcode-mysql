## 569.不用内置的函数取中值
###解题思路
深深的叹服，中值表面上看就是表示大小，但是如果从另一个角度看，中值和其他值在比较过程中的正负号是有规律的，所以这个算法就是根据这个规律做的
###代码
    SELECT
    Employee.Id, Employee.Company, Employee.Salary
    FROM
    Employee,
    Employee alias
    WHERE
    Employee.Company = alias.Company
    GROUP BY Employee.Company , Employee.Salary
    HAVING SUM(CASE
    WHEN Employee.Salary = alias.Salary THEN 1
    ELSE 0
    END) >= ABS(SUM(SIGN(Employee.Salary - alias.Salary)))
    ORDER BY Employee.Id
