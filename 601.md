##601.连续值都大于某个值，把连续的都取出来
###解题思路###
笛卡尔积增加行，通过筛选条件把连续的都取出来，有几个连续的，就要考虑几种条件
###代码###
    SELECT s1.* FROM stadium AS s1, stadium AS s2, stadium as s3
    WHERE 
    ((s1.id + 1 = s2.id
    AND s1.id + 2 = s3.id)
    OR 
    (s1.id - 1 = s2.id
    AND s1.id + 1 = s3.id)
    OR
    (s1.id - 2 = s2.id
    AND s1.id - 1 = s3.id)
    )
    AND s1.people>=100 
    AND s2.people>=100
    AND s3.people>=100
    GROUP BY s1.id
