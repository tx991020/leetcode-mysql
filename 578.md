### 解题思路
用case when 打标签 另外order by 可以用公式
### 代码
    SELECT question_id as survey_log
    FROM
    (
    SELECT question_id,
     SUM(case when action="answer" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as num_answer,
    SUM(case when action="show" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as num_show,
    FROM survey_log
    GROUP BY question_id
    ) as tbl
    ORDER BY (num_answer / num_show) DESC
    LIMIT 1
### 代码
    SELECT 
    question_id AS 'survey_log'
    FROM
    survey_log
    GROUP BY question_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(answer_id) / COUNT(IF(action = 'show', 1, 0)) DESC
    LIMIT 1;
